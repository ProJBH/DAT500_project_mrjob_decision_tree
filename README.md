## Project_mrjob_decision_tree
### Project Description
The main project aims to compare the performance between python, Hadoop, and Spark when processing large datasets.
During the project, the core functionalities of the decision tree are from the following website [Decision Tree from Scratch](https://github.com/SebastianMantey/Decision-Tree-from-Scratch)

### How to Use the Project
Ideally, this project can be run at any size of the dataset and use the decision tree algorithm to predict the classified target value. The decision tree doesn't support regression prediction.
